  # StreamNative Cloud - GCP BYOC Vendor Access
  
  This Terraform module creates IAM policies within your GCP project. These resources give StreamNative access only for the provisioning and management of StreamNative's BYOC offering.

  For more information about StreamNative and our managed offerings for Apache Pulsar, visit our [website](https://streamnative.io/streamnativecloud/).

  ## Usage

  To use this module you must have [Terraform installed](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) and be [familiar](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started) with its usage for GCP. It is recommended to securely store the Terraform configuration you create in source control, as well as use [Terraform's Remote State](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/remote) for storing the `*.tfstate` file.

  ### Get Started

  Start by writing the following configuration to a new file `main.tf` containing the following Terraform code:

  ```hcl
  {{ include "docs/main.tf" }}
  ```

  After [authenticating to your GCP account](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration) execute the following sequence of commands from the directory containing the `main.tf` configuration file:
  1. `terraform init`
     <details><summary>(example output)</summary><p>

     ```bash
     {{ include "docs/init.log" | nindent 3 }}
     ```
     
     </p></details>
  2. `terraform plan`
     <details><summary>(example output)</summary><p>

     ```bash
     {{ include "docs/plan.log" | nindent 3 }}
     ```
     
     </p></details>
  3. `terraform apply`
     <details><summary>(example output)</summary><p>

     ```bash
     {{ include "docs/apply.log" | nindent 3 }}
     ```
     
     </p></details>
